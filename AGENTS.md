# Repository Agent Guide

This file applies to the entire repository. Keep changes scoped, preserve
unrelated work, and use `gofmt` for every modified Go file.

## Build and test

- Build: `go build ./cmd`
- Full test suite: `DWS_PACKAGE_VERSION=0.0.0-test go test ./...`
- Generate Schema assets: `go generate ./internal/cli`
- Check generated drift: `./scripts/policy/check-generated-drift.sh`
- Check the Schema contract: `./scripts/policy/check-schema-catalog.sh`

Generated Schema JSON is committed. Change its source inputs and generators,
then regenerate; do not hand-edit generated Catalog or Agent metadata files.
`internal/cli/schema_command_registry.json` is different: it is a reviewed
`CommandRegistry` source, not a generated snapshot. It is the single reviewed
source of stable canonical identity,
primary paths, aliases, and navigation. Edit it only when reviewed exposure,
identity, primary path, or aliases change; parameter, Skill, and metadata-only
changes must not rewrite it mechanically.

## Agent Schema contract

The Schema data flow is one way:

```text
1. app.NewRootCommand()
   └─ builds the real Cobra command tree and flags

2. schema_command_registry.json
   + schema_manual_hints.json.commands
   └─ forms EffectiveCommandRegistry
      └─ binds exactly to real Cobra leaves and aliases

3. Parameter resolution
   Cobra flags
   + schema_parameter_bindings.json
   + schema_manual_hints.json.commands[].parameters
   └─ produces ParameterSpec and constraints

4. Agent and interface semantics
   schema_manual_hints.json.agent_hints
   + reviewed safety/interface structured hints
   + pinned MCP metadata
   └─ resolves Agent metadata by source precedence
      Markdown is evidence only; it is not concatenated into final prose

5. One typed hub
   BoundCommandRegistry
   + ParameterSpec
   + Agent metadata
   + Interface metadata
   └─ resolves every command exactly once into ToolSpec
      └─ aggregates SchemaRegistry + SchemaIndex

6. One-way publication
   SchemaRegistry
   └─ internal/cli/schema_catalog.json
      └─ dws schema list/product/group/leaf/--all
```

Manual command additions are normalized into `EffectiveCommandRegistry`
*before* Cobra binding; after that point there is no second identity source and
no identity precedence winner. The binder must reject a missing/non-runnable
Cobra path, an alias collision, and any native identity annotation that
disagrees with the effective registry. A missing native identity annotation is
allowed because annotations are implementation-side assertions, not identity
fallbacks.

The assembler resolves every bound command exactly once into one `ToolSpec`.
Build-time gates and the snapshot serializer consume that source-resolved typed
registry/index. Runtime projections and delivery gates consume the typed
registry/index returned by the production snapshot loader. Neither path may
reopen annotations, merge source records, or use a previous Catalog or other
generated JSON as a source. `schema_catalog.json` is output-only in the
generation graph. The production loader decoding the embedded published
snapshot is a delivery boundary, not source resolution; it must never create or
repair a Cobra command, flag, registry entry, or later Catalog generation.

This split is architecturally isomorphic to Lark's typed metadata registry,
navigation catalog, and schema renderer. DWS intentionally preserves its
existing flat JSON wire contract for compatibility; do not treat architectural
alignment as permission to make an unversioned wire-format change.

The reviewed `CommandRegistry` is the sole source of stable command identity
and navigation. The executable Cobra tree remains the source of truth for
whether a CLI path exists, is runnable, and which flags it accepts. Schema
coverage is bidirectional:

1. Every final `SchemaRegistry` tool, including its serialized Catalog
   projection, must resolve to an executable Cobra command.
2. Every public runnable Cobra leaf must either resolve to Schema or appear as
   an exact, reviewed exclusion with a non-empty reason in
   `internal/cli/schema_command_exclusions.json`.

Do not use prefix or wildcard exclusions: they can silently hide future
commands. Remove an exclusion when its command enters Schema; stale, invalid,
or duplicate exclusions must fail generation and CI.

When adding or changing an Agent-visible command, review all relevant inputs:

- `internal/cli/schema_command_registry.json` for the reviewed
  `CommandRegistry`: canonical identity, primary CLI path, aliases, and stable
  navigation. It is the identity source and is not a generated artifact.
- `internal/cli/schema_command_registry.schema.json` is its closed,
  machine-readable editing contract. Preserve the local `$schema` reference;
  unknown fields, invalid visibility values, stale paths, and collisions fail
  Go validation and policy.
- `internal/cli/schema_manual_hints.json` is the single reviewed manual input.
  Its `commands` section adds an exact existing runnable Cobra leaf to the
  effective registry or overrides a Schema-only flag projection. Its
  `agent_hints` section owns reviewed Agent selection prose for products and
  tools. Command additions are merged before binding; neither section forms a
  runtime fallback.
- Native Runtime Schema identity annotations, when present, as consistency
  assertions against `EffectiveCommandRegistry`. They must agree exactly and
  must never materialize, infer, or override registry identity.
- `internal/cli/schema_manual_hints.schema.json` is the machine-readable
  editing contract for Manual Schema hints; read it before changing the JSON.
- Flag-to-interface property mappings and required/default semantics.
- `skills/mono/schema-hints/` for selection, interface, and safety metadata.
- Generated files under `internal/cli/schema_agent_metadata/` and
  `internal/cli/schema_catalog.json` after running generation.

Run the reverse-completeness tests whenever the Cobra tree changes. A command
that works through `dws <path>` but cannot be found through the matching
`dws schema` lookup is a contract failure unless it has a reviewed exact
exclusion.

Manual Schema hints must reference an exact public runnable Cobra leaf and
real flags. They may override Schema description, interface-property/type
mapping, `required`, and `required_when`; they must not create commands or
flags, define an interface, or advertise an unknown RPC. Every entry requires
`reviewed: true` and a non-empty reason.

For Agent-authored Manual Schema hints:

1. Preserve the `$schema` field and version.
2. Confirm the exact command and flag names in the current Cobra tree.
3. Add the smallest possible entry; do not copy generated Catalog fields into
   the input.
4. Describe user-visible semantics in `reason` and parameter descriptions.
5. Run generation, drift, Schema policy, and the focused CLI tests before
   proposing the change.

## Manual Agent hints

Agent-facing selection prose is a reviewed, versioned source inside
`internal/cli/schema_manual_hints.json`; do not create a second Agent-hint
source file. Keep command/parameter overrides in `commands` and keep
`agent_summary`, `use_when`, `avoid_when`, and `examples` under
`agent_hints`. A tool hint is keyed by its exact canonical path and must match
the Effective CommandRegistry. Product and tool entries require a review
reason and evidence.

AI may be used offline to produce one complete candidate batch. Commit that
batch as reviewed manual input and preserve its `generated_by`, `model`,
`prompt_version`, and `batch` provenance. Normal `go generate`, builds, tests,
and runtime startup must never invoke a model, rewrite this manual file, or
semantically concatenate Markdown into the selected Agent prose. They may only
read, validate, resolve, and project the committed values. Markdown and Help
are evidence for authoring and drift checks, not hidden description winners.

The initial AI-authored baseline must cover the exact Effective
CommandRegistry tool set and all published products in one revision. Each
product/tool entry references a declared revision record. Later human or Agent
work may add a new revision record and update only the reviewed target entries;
unchanged entries retain their original provenance. Missing or unknown revision
references fail validation. The generation pipeline must not fill missing
prose from Catalog, generated Agent metadata, or a prior snapshot.

Manual Agent hints may select or revise prose, including choosing a more or
less restrictive recommendation. They cannot create a Cobra command or flag,
change parameter facts, invent an RPC/interface, alter safety metadata, or
bypass command completeness. Examples must use an executable primary/alias
path and flags accepted by the live Cobra command; never add `--yes` to stored
examples.

Treat every tool `use_when` entry as a reviewed positive selection scenario
whose expected result is that tool's canonical path, and every `avoid_when`
entry as a reviewed negative scenario that must not choose that tool. The
deterministic gate derives a typed evaluation fixture from these same fields;
it requires exact tool coverage, a real runnable `BoundCommandRegistry`
primary command, at least one positive and negative assertion per tool, and no
literal contradictory expectations. It does not claim that string matching
proves natural-language understanding.

Semantic selection is an explicit opt-in live-model check. Run the smoke set
(one positive and one negative scenario per product) with
`DWS_AGENT_SELECTION_LIVE=1 ARK_API_KEY=... ARK_BASE_URL=... ARK_MODEL=... go test ./internal/app -run TestManualAgentSelectionArkLive -count=1`.
Add `DWS_AGENT_SELECTION_FULL=1` to evaluate every committed tool scenario, or
set `DWS_AGENT_SELECTION_CASES` to comma-separated fixture case IDs. Normal CI
never calls a model; its blockers remain the reproducible fixture, binding,
example, provenance, and final-delivery facts.

The live evaluator sends only case IDs/scenarios plus one same-product
candidate table; expected/forbidden assertions stay local and must never be
included in the model prompt. Built-in Ark HTTPS bases are allowlisted. A
different HTTPS provider requires its exact base in
`DWS_AGENT_SELECTION_ALLOWED_BASE_URLS`; plaintext HTTP is accepted only for a
loopback test server so API credentials are never sent to an arbitrary clear
text endpoint.

## Safety metadata

Parameter and safety resolution is source-precedence based and value-neutral.
Do not choose a winner because one value looks stricter: a higher-priority
reviewed manual/explicit source may intentionally raise or lower `required`,
`effect`, `risk`, `confirmation`, or `idempotency`. Preserve all candidates and
the selected source in provenance, and fail same-precedence conflicts rather
than silently merging them. Cobra's hard-required marker remains an executable
fact even when the Agent projection is deliberately different.

For every delivered `ToolSpec` and `ParameterSpec` field, the provenance
winner value must exactly equal the delivered value. Checking only source,
count, presence, or hash is not a sufficient final-delivery invariant.

The same resolved `ToolSpec` must drive every projection. The full leaf payload
must equal the corresponding tool in `schema --all` and the full Catalog tool.
Overview/product/group summaries and Catalog summaries must equal
`ToolSpec.ToSummaryPayload()`. An alias lookup may change only the view fields
`cli_path` and `is_alias`; it must not re-resolve or mutate the command
contract.

This build-time rule is distinct from runtime drift handling. If shipped Help
and leaf Schema disagree, pass only flags accepted by Cobra. For conflicting
safety information, do not silently take the less restrictive behavior: use
the safer interpretation or stop and report the contract drift.

Do not infer one safety field from another. In particular, `effect=destructive`
or `risk=high` does not mechanically rewrite `confirmation`; the final
precedence winner for each field is authoritative. When
`confirmation=user_required`, obtain confirmation before adding `--yes`.
Keep CLI confirmation behavior and Schema metadata consistent, and add a
semantic regression test through the final embedded loader/query delivery
path; a generator unit test or JSON count alone is insufficient.

## Current Schema boundaries

- `schema list` remains a progressive overview. `schema --all` is the stable
  full-export contract: every final `SchemaIndex` tool must contain its
  complete leaf parameters, constraints, and safety semantics, including an empty
  `parameters` object for commands without flags. Keep it suitable for the #602
  compatibility baseline and fail rather than silently emitting a partial
  export.
- `schema --all` is not normal command discovery. Use overview -> product/group
  -> leaf for routine Agent work. `--compact` is supported for context-saving
  projections, but a compact full export is not a complete compatibility
  baseline.
- `dws <path> --help` defines whether Cobra exposes a path and which flags the
  executable accepts. A leaf Schema defines Agent selection, parameter mapping
  and constraints, and safety/confirmation semantics. A conflict is contract
  drift, not permission to guess.
- Schema and Help describe commands; neither returns DingTalk business data.
  After discovery, execute the real read/search/list command to obtain data.
